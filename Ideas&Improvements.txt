1: Use Typescript.

2: Write end-to-end cypress test: This may be useful to reduce bugs and have end-to-end testing. 
Cypress can be beneficial when we have more than one SPA app component.

3: Use dotenv for constants, URLs, and credentials. It can be helpful to handle various environments like development,
staging and production.

4: Include logging. Logging can be helpful to debug. To extend even further, we can also include structured logging.

5: Show default 404 not found or error page.

6: Divide the project in sub files
